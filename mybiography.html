      <h3>Short Biography and Experience With Programming</h3>
      <p>
        My full name is Stephan David Foster, I enjoy working with computers and
        I find technology fascinating. I want to have a better understanding of
        the ongoings behind the technology I use and that is what drew me to the
        course. I am proficient in mathematics and writing. Organization would
        be one of my weak points and almost an Achilles heel of mine. I enjoy a
        good book but also enjoy getting outside, admittedly I spend awhile on
        computers daily. After this course is finished, I hope to be able to
        fill those hours spent on a computer with something productive. My
        experience with programming is limited with common programming
        languages. However, I spent quite a bit of time using Scratch in
        elementary and from this experience have a decent grasp on the
        fundamentals of coding. Like understanding how language in general works
        without actually speaking that language.
